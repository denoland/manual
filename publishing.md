# Publishing Modules

Deno is not prescriptive about how developers make their modules
availableâ€”modules may be imported from any source. To help publish and
distribute modules, separate standalone solutions are provided.

## Publishing on deno.land/x

A common way to publish Deno modules is via the official
[https://deno.land/x](https://deno.land/x) hosting service. It caches releases
of open source modules and serves them at one easy to remember domain.

To use it, modules must be developed and hosted in public repositories on
GitHub. Their source is then published to deno.land/x on tag creation. They can
then be accessed by using a url in the following format:

```
https://deno.land/x/<module_name>@<tag_name>/<file_path>
```

Module versions are persistent and immutable. It is thus not possible to edit or
delete a module (or version), to prevent breaking programs that rely on this
module. Modules may be removed if there is a legal reason to do so (for example
copyright infringement).

For more details, see [Adding a Module](https://deno.land/add_module).
