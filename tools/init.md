# Starting a new project

Starting a new project with Deno has always been incredibly simple: you just
need a single file to get going. No need for any configuration files, dependency
manifests, or build scripts.

Users coming from other ecosystems are often not used to this simplicity - they
often look for a tool to scaffold out a basic project structure to get them
started on the right path. In this release we have added a deno init subcommand
that scaffolds a basic Deno project.

```sh
$ deno init
✅ Project initialized
Run these commands to get started
  deno run main.ts
  deno test

$ deno run main.ts
Add 2 + 3 = 5

$ deno test
Check file:///dev/main_test.ts
running 1 test from main_test.ts
addTest ... ok (6ms)

ok | 1 passed | 0 failed (29ms)
```

This subcommand will create two files (`main.ts` and `main_test.ts`). These
files provide a basic example of how to write a Deno program and how to write
tests for it. The `main.ts` file exports a `add` function that adds two numbers
together and the `main_test.ts` file contains a test for this function.

You can also specify an argument to `deno init` to initialize a project in a
specific directory:

```sh
$ deno init my_deno_project
✅ Project initialized
Run these commands to get started
  cd my_deno_project
  deno run main.ts
  deno test
```
