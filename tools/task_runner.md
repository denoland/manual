# Task Runner

`deno task` provides a cross platform way to define and execute custom commands
specific to a codebase.

To get started, define your commands in your codebase's
[Deno configuration file](../getting_started/configuration_file.md) under a
`"tasks"` key.

For example:

```jsonc
{
  "tasks": {
    "data": "deno task collect && deno task analyze",
    "collect": "deno run --allow-read=. --allow-write=. scripts/collect.js",
    "analyze": "deno run --allow-read=. scripts/analyze.js"
  }
}
```

## Listing tasks

To get an output showing all the defined tasks, run:

```sh
deno task
```

## Executing a task

To execute a specific task, run:

```shell
deno task task-name [additional args]...
```

In the example above, to run the `data` task we would do:

```shell
deno task data
```

## Specifying the current working directory

By default, `deno task` executes commands with the directory of the Deno
configuration file (ex. _deno.json_) as the current working directory. This
allows tasks to use relative paths and continue to work regardless of where in
the directory tree you happen to execute the deno task from. In some scenarios,
this may not be desired and this behavior can be overridden with the `INIT_CWD` environment variable.

`INIT_CWD` will be set with the full path to the directory the task was run in, if not already set. This aligns with the same behavior as `npm run`.

For example, the following task will change the current working directory of the task to be in the same directory the user ran the task from and then output the current working directory which is now that directory (remember, this works on Windows too because deno task is cross platform).

```
{
  "tasks": {
    "my_task": "cd $INIT_CWD && pwd"
  }
}
```

## Getting directory `deno task` was run from

Since tasks are run using the directory of the Deno configuration file as the
current working directory, it may be useful to know the directory the
`deno task` was executed from instead. This is possible by using the `INIT_CWD`
environment variable in a task or script launched from `deno task` (works the
same way as in `npm run`, but in a cross platform way).

For example, to provide this directory to a script in a task, do the following
(note the directory is surrounded in double quotes to keep it as a single
argument in case it contains spaces):

```json
{
  "tasks": {
    "start": "deno run main.ts \"$INIT_CWD\""
  }
}
```

## Syntax

`deno task` uses a cross platform shell that's a subset of sh/bash to execute
defined tasks.

### Boolean lists

Boolean lists provide a way to execute additional commands based on the exit
code of the initial command. They separate commands using the `&&` and `||`
operators.

The `&&` operator provides a way to execute a command and if it _succeeds_ (has
an exit code of `0`) it will execute the next command:

```sh
deno run --allow-read=. --allow-write=. collect.ts && deno run --allow-read=. analyze.ts
```

The `||` operator is the opposite. It provides a way to execute a command and
only if it _fails_ (has a non-zero exit code) it will execute the next command:

```sh
deno run --allow-read=. --allow-write=. collect.ts || deno run play_sad_music.ts
```

### Sequential lists

Sequential lists are similar to boolean lists, but execute regardless of whether
the previous command in the list passed or failed. Commands are separated with a
semi-colon (`;`).

```sh
deno run output_data.ts ; deno run --allow-net server.ts
```

### Async commands

Async commands provide a way to make a command execute asynchronously. This can
be useful when starting multiple processes. To make a command asynchronous, add
an `&` to the end of it. For example the following would execute
`sleep 1 && deno run --allow-net client.ts` and `deno run --allow-net server.ts`
at the same time:

```sh
sleep 1 && deno run --allow-net client.ts & deno run --allow-net server.ts
```

Unlike in most shells, the first async command to fail will cause all the other
commands to fail immediately. In the example above, this would mean that if the
client command fails then the server command will also fail and exit. You can
opt out of this behavior by adding `|| true` to the end of a command, which will
force a `0` exit code. For example:

```sh
deno run --allow-net client.ts || true & deno run --allow-net server.ts || true
```

### Environment variables

Environment variables are defined like the following:

```sh
export VAR_NAME=value
```

Here's an example of using one in a task with shell variable substitution and
then with it being exported as part of the environment of the spawned Deno
process (note that in the JSON configuration file the double quotes would need
to be escaped with backslashes):

```sh
export VAR=hello && echo $VAR && deno eval "console.log('Deno: ' + Deno.env.get('VAR'))"
```

Would output:

```
hello
Deno: hello
```

#### Setting environment variables for a command

To specify environment variable(s) before a command, list them like so:

```
VAR=hello VAR2=bye deno run main.ts
```

This will use those environment variables specifically for the following
command.

### Shell variables

Shell variables are similar to environment variables, but won't be exported to
spawned commands. They are defined with the following syntax:

```sh
VAR_NAME=value
```

If we use a shell variable instead of an environment variable in a similar
example to what's shown in the previous "Environment variables" section:

```sh
VAR=hello && echo $VAR && deno eval "console.log('Deno: ' + Deno.env.get('VAR'))"
```

We will get the following output:

```
hello
Deno: undefined
```

Shell variables can be useful when we want to re-use a value, but don't want it
available in any spawned processes.

### Pipelines

Pipelines provide a way to pipe the output of one command to another.

The following command pipes the stdout output "Hello" to the stdin of the
spawned Deno process:

```sh
echo Hello | deno run main.ts
```

To pipe stdout and stderr, use `|&` instead:

```sh
deno eval 'console.log(1); console.error(2);' |& deno run main.ts
```

### Command substitution

The `$(command)` syntax provides a way to use the output of a command in other
commands that get executed.

For example, to provide the output of getting the latest git revision to another
command you could do the following:

```sh
deno run main.ts $(git rev-parse HEAD)
```

Another example using a shell variable:

```sh
REV=$(git rev-parse HEAD) && deno run main.ts $REV && echo $REV
```

### Negate exit code

To negate the exit code, add an exclamation point and space before a command:

```sh
# change the exit code from 1 to 0
! deno eval 'Deno.exit(1);'
```

### Redirects

Redirects provide a way to pipe stdout and/or stderr to a file.

For example, the following redirects _stdout_ of `deno run main.ts` to a file
called `file.txt` on the file system:

```sh
deno run main.ts > file.txt
```

To instead redirect _stderr_, use `2>`:

```sh
deno run main.ts 2> file.txt
```

To redirect both stdout _and_ stderr, use `&>`:

```sh
deno run main.ts &> file.txt
```

To append to a file, instead of overwriting an existing one, use two right angle
brackets instead of one:

```sh
deno run main.ts >> file.txt
```

Suppressing either stdout, stderr, or both of a command is possible by
redirecting to `/dev/null`. This works in a cross platform way including on
Windows.

```sh
# suppress stdout
deno run main.ts > /dev/null
# suppress stderr
deno run main.ts 2> /dev/null
# suppress both stdout and stderr
deno run main.ts &> /dev/null
```

Note that redirecting input and multiple redirects are currently not supported.

### Future syntax

We are planning to support
[glob expansion](https://github.com/denoland/deno_task_shell/issues/6) in the
future.

## Built-in commands

`deno task` ships with several built-in commands that work the same out of the
box on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

- [`cp`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cp.1.html) - Copies files.
- [`mv`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/mv.1.html) - Moves files.
- [`rm`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/rm.1.html) - Remove files or
  directories.
  - Ex: `rm -rf [FILE]...` - Commonly used to recursively delete files or
    directories.
- [`mkdir`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/mkdir.1.html) - Makes
  directories.
  - Ex. `mkdir -p DIRECTORY...` - Commonly used to make a directory and all its
    parents with no error if it exists.
- [`pwd`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pwd.1.html) - Prints the name of
  the current/working directory.
- [`sleep`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/sleep.1.html) - Delays for a
  specified amount of time.
  - Ex. `sleep 1` to sleep for 1 second, `sleep 0.5` to sleep for half a second,
    or `sleep 1m` to sleep a minute
- [`echo`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/echo.1.html) - Displays a line
  of text.
- [`cat`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cat.1.html) - Concatenates files
  and outputs them on stdout. When no arguments are provided it reads and
  outputs stdin.
- [`exit`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/exit.1p.html) - Causes the
  shell to exit.
- [`xargs`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/xargs.1p.html) - Builds
  arguments from stdin and executes a command.

If you find a useful flag missing on a command or have any suggestions for
additional commands that should be supported out of the box, then please
[open an issue](https://github.com/denoland/deno_task_shell/issues) on the
[deno_task_shell](https://github.com/denoland/deno_task_shell/) repo.

Note that if you wish to execute any of these commands in a non-cross platform
way on Mac or Linux, then you may do so by running it through `sh`:
`sh -c <command>` (ex. `sh -c cp source destination`).
