# Node and npm modules

Many people will want to leverage code and libraries that are built for
[Node](https://nodejs.org/), in particular the large set of packages available
on the [npm](https://npmjs.com/) registry.

There are currently several ways to do this:

- Using [`npm:` specifiers](./node/npm_specifiers.md) and
  [`node:` specifiers](./node/node_specifiers.md)
- [package.json compatibility](./node/package_json.md)
- Using [CDNs](./node/cdns.md)
