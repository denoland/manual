# Deno KV's Key Space

- Deno KV is a key value store
- Key space is a flat namespace of key+value+versionstamp pairs
- The versionstamp represents when a value was inserted / modified

## Keys

Keys in Deno KV are sequences of key parts, which can be `string`s, `number`s,
`boolean`s, `Uint8Array`s, or `bigint`s.

Using a sequence of parts, rather than a single string eliminates the
possibility of delimiter injection attacks, because there is no visible
delimiter.

Between key parts, invisible delimiters are used to separate the parts. These
delimiters are never visible, but ensure that one part can not be confused with
another part. For example, the key parts `["abc", "def"]`, `["ab", "cdef"]`,
`["abc", "", "def"]` are all different keys.

Keys are case sensitive and are ordered lexicographically by their parts. The
first part is the most significant, and the last part is the least significant.
The order of the parts is determined by both the type and the value of the part.

### Key Part Ordering

Key parts are ordered lexicographically by their type, and within a given type,
they are ordered by their value. The ordering of types is as follows:

1. `Uint8Array`
1. `string`
1. `number`
1. `bigint`
1. `boolean`

Within a given type, the ordering is:

- `Uint8Array`: byte ordering of the array
- `string`: byte ordering of the UTF-8 encoding of the string
- `number`: -NaN < -Infinity < -1.0 < -0.5 < -0.0 < 0.0 < 0.5 < 1.0 < Infinity <
  NaN
- `bigint`: mathematical ordering, largest negative number first, largest
  positive number last
- `boolean`: false < true

This means that the part `1.0` (a number) is ordered before the part `2.0` (also
a number), but is greater than the part `0n` (a bigint), because `1.0` is a
number and `0n` is a bigint, and type ordering has precedence over the ordering
of values within a type.

### Key Examples

```js
["users", 42, "profile"]; // User with ID 42's profile
["posts", "2023-04-23", "comments"]; // Comments for all posts on 2023-04-23
["products", "electronics", "smartphones", "apple"]; // Apple smartphones in the electronics category
["orders", 1001, "shipping", "tracking"]; // Tracking information for order ID 1001
["files", new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3]), "metadata"]; // Metadata for a file with Uint8Array identifier
["projects", "openai", "tasks", 5]; // Task with ID 5 in the OpenAI project
["events", "2023-03-31", "location", "san_francisco"]; // Events in San Francisco on 2023-03-31
["invoices", 2023, "Q1", "summary"]; // Summary of Q1 invoices for 2023
["teams", "engineering", "members", 1n]; // Member with ID 1n in the engineering team
```

## Values

Values in Deno KV can be arbitrary JavaScript values that are compatible with
the [structured clone algorithm][structured clone algorithm]. This includes:

- `undefined`
- `null`
- `boolean`
- `number`
- `string`
- `bigint`
- `Uint8Array`
- `Array`
- `Object`
- `Map`
- `Set`
- `Date`
- `RegExp`

Objects and arrays can contain any of the above types, including other objects
and arrays. `Map`s and `Set`s can contain any of the above types, including
other `Map`s and `Set`s.

Circular references within values are supported.

Objects with a non-primitive prototype are not supported (such as class
instances or Web API objects). Functions and symbols can also not be serialized.

### `Deno.KvU64` type

In addition to structured serializable values, the special value `Deno.KvU64` is
also supported as a value. This object represents a 64-bit unsigned integer,
represented as a bigint. It can be used with the `sum`, `min`, and `max` KV
operations. It can not be stored within an object or array. It must be stored as
a top-level value.

It can be created with the `Deno.KvU64` constructor:

```js
const u64 = new Deno.KvU64(42n);
```

### Value Examples

```js
undefined;
null;
true;
false;
42;
-42.5;
42n;
"hello";
new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3]);
[1, 2, 3];
{ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
new Map([["a", 1], ["b", 2], ["c", 3]]);
new Set([1, 2, 3]);
new Date("2023-04-23");
/abc/;

// Circular references are supported
const a = {};
const b = { a };
a.b = b;

// Deno.KvU64 is supported
new Deno.KvU64(42n);
```

## Versionstamp

// todo

- All data in the KV store is versioned
- Versionstamps are 12 byte hex strings
- Versionstamps are monotonically increasing, but not necessarily sequential
- Versionstamps can be compared for "staleness" (e.g. if a versionstamp is
  greater than another versionstamp, then it is newer)
- All operations that happen in one transaction will assign the same
  versionstamp to all of the data that is modified

Versionstamps are used to implement optimistic concurrency control. Atomic
operations can have checks on the versionstamp of the data they are operating
on. If the versionstamp of the data is not what is expected, then the
transaction will fail and the operation will not be applied.
