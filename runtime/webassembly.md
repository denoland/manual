# Using WebAssembly

Designed to be used alongside JavaScript to speed up key application components,
[WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) can have much higher, and more
consistent execution speed than JavaScript, similar to C, C++, or Rust. Deno can
execute WebAssembly modules with the same interfaces that
[browsers provide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly).

In this chapter we will discuss:

1. [Using WebAssembly in Deno](webassembly/using_wasm.md)
2. [Using the Streaming WebAssembly APIs](webassembly/using_streaming_wasm.md)
3. [Helpful Resources](webassembly/wasm_resources.md)
