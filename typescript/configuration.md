## Configuring TypeScript in Deno

TypeScript comes with a load of different options that can be configured, but
Deno strives to make it easy to use TypeScript with Deno. Lots of different
options frustrates that goal. To make things easier, Deno configures TypeScript
to "just work" and shouldn't require additional configuration.

That being said, Deno does support using a TypeScript configuration file, though
like the rest of Deno, the detection and use of a configuration file is not
automatic. To use a TypeScript configuration file with Deno, you have to provide
a path on the command line. For example:

```
> deno run --config ./deno.json main.ts
```

### How Deno uses a configuration file

Deno does not process a TypeScript configuration file like `tsc` does, as there
are lots of parts of a TypeScript configuration file that are meaningless in a
Deno context or would cause Deno to not function properly if they were applied.

Deno only looks at the `compilerOptions` section of a configuration file, and
even then it only considers certain compiler options, with the rest being
ignored.

Here is a table of compiler options that can be changed, their default in Deno
and any other notes about that option:

### What an implied tsconfig.json looks like

It is impossible to get `tsc` to behave like Deno. It is also difficult to get
the TypeScript language service to behave like Deno. This is why we have built a
language service directly into Deno. That being said, it can be useful to
understand what is implied.

If you were to write a `tsconfig.json` for Deno, it would look something like
this:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "allowJs": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "inlineSourceMap": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "jsx": "react",
    "lib": ["deno.window"],
    "module": "esnext",
    "strict": true,
    "target": "esnext",
    "useDefineForClassFields": true
  }
}
```

You can't copy paste this into a configuration file and get it to work,
specifically because of the built-in type libraries that are custom to Deno
which are provided to the TypeScript compiler. This can somewhat be mocked by
running `deno types` on the command line and piping the output to a file and
including that in the files as part of the program, removing the `"lib"` option,
and setting the `"noLib"` option to `true`.

If you use the `--unstable` flag, Deno will change the `"lib"` option to
`[ "deno.window", "deno.unstable" ]`. If you are trying to load a worker, that
is type checked with `"deno.worker"` instead of `"deno.window"`. See
[Type Checking Web Workers](./types#type-checking-web-workers) for more
information on this.

### Using the "lib" property

Deno has several libraries built into it that are not present in other
platforms, like `tsc`. This is what enables Deno to properly check code written
for Deno. In some situations though, this automatic behavior can cause
challenges, for example like writing code that is intended to also run in a
browser. In these situations the `"lib"` property of a `compilerOptions` can be
used to modify the behavior of Deno when type checking code.

The built-in libraries that are of interest to users:

- `"deno.ns"` - This includes all the custom `Deno` global namespace APIs plus
  the Deno additions to `import.meta`. This should generally not conflict with
  other libraries or global types.
- `"deno.unstable"` - This includes the addition unstable `Deno` global
  namespace APIs.
- `"deno.window"` - This is the "default" library used when checking Deno main
  runtime scripts. It includes the `"deno.ns"` as well as other type libraries
  for the extensions that are built into Deno. This library will conflict with
  libraries like `"dom"` and `"dom.iterable"` that are standard TypeScript
  libraries.
- `"deno.worker"` - This is the library used when checking a Deno web worker
  script. For more information about web workers, check out
  [Type Checking Web Workers](./types#type-checking-web-workers).
- `"dom.asynciterable"` - TypeScript currently does not include the DOM async
  iterables that Deno implements (plus several browsers), so we have implemented
  it ourselves until it becomes available in TypeScript.

These are common libraries that Deno doesn't use, but are useful when writing
code that is intended to also work in another runtime:

- `"dom"` - The main browser global library that ships with TypeScript. The type
  definitions conflict in many ways with `"deno.window"` and so if `"dom"` is
  used, then consider using just `"deno.ns"` to expose the Deno specific APIs.
- `"dom.iterable"` - The iterable extensions to the browser global library.
- `"scripthost"` - The library for the Microsoft Windows Script Host.
- `"webworker"` - The main library for web workers in the browser. Like `"dom"`
  this will conflict with `"deno.window"` or `"deno.worker"`, so consider using
  just `"deno.ns"` to expose the Deno specific APIs.
- `"webworker.importscripts"` - The library that exposes the `importScripts()`
  API in the web worker.
- `"webworker.iterable"` - The library that adds iterables to objects within a
  web worker. Modern browsers support this.

#### Targeting Deno and the Browser

A common use case is writing code that works in Deno and the browser, and have
the code "sniff" to determine if it is running in the browser or in Deno. If
that is the case a common configuration of a `compilerOptions` would look like
this:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "esnext",
    "lib": ["dom", "dom.iterable", "dom.asynciterable", "deno.ns"]
  }
}
```

This should allow most code to be type checked properly by Deno.

If you expect to run the code in Deno with the `--unstable` flag, then you will
want to add that library to the mix as well:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "esnext",
    "lib": [
      "dom",
      "dom.iterable",
      "dom.asynciterable",
      "deno.ns",
      "deno.unstable"
    ]
  }
}
```

Typically when you use the `"lib"` option in TypeScript, you need to include an
"es" library as well. In the case of `"deno.ns"` and `"deno.unstable"`, they
automatically include `"esnext"` when you bring them in.

The biggest "danger" when doing something like this, is that the type checking
is significantly looser, and there is no way to validate that you are doing
sufficient and effective feature detection in your code, which may lead to what
could be trivial errors becoming runtime errors.

### Using the "types" property

The `"types"` property in `"compilerOptions"` can be used to specify arbitrary
type definitions to include when type checking a program. For more information
on this see
[Using ambient or global types](./types#using-ambient-or-global-types).
