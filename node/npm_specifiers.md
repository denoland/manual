# `npm:` specifiers

Since version 1.28, Deno has native support for importing npm packages. This is
done by importing using `npm:` specifiers.

The way these work is best described with an example:

```ts, ignore
import chalk from "npm:chalk@5";

console.log(chalk.green("Hello!"));
```

These npm specifiers have the following format:

```ts, ignore
npm:<package-name>[@<version-requirement>][/<sub-path>]
```

Another example with express:

```js, ignore
// main.js
import express from "npm:express@^4.17";
const app = express();

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello World");
});

app.listen(3000);
console.log("listening on http://localhost:3000/");
```

Then doing the following will start a simple express server:

```sh
$ deno run -A main.js
listening on http://localhost:3000/
```

When doing this, no `npm install` is necessary and no `node_modules` folder is
created. These packages are also subject to the same permissions as Deno
applications.

These specifiers currently work with all `deno` subcommands, except
`deno compile` and `deno vendor`.

## npm executable scripts

npm packages with `bin` entries can be executed from the command line without an
`npm install` using a specifier in the following format:

```ts, ignore
npm:<package-name>[@<version-requirement>][/<binary-name>]
```

For example:

```sh
$ deno run --allow-env --allow-read npm:cowsay@1.5.0 Hello there!
 ______________
< Hello there! >
 --------------
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||

$ deno run --allow-env --allow-read npm:cowsay@1.5.0/cowthink What to eat?
 ______________
( What to eat? )
 --------------
        o   ^__^
         o  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||
```

## TypeScript types

Many packages ship with types out of the box, you can import those and use them
with types easily:

```ts, ignore
import chalk from "npm:chalk@5";
```

Some packages do not though, but you can specify their types with a
[`@deno-types`](../advanced/typescript/types.md) directive. For example, using a
[`@types`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/type-declarations.html#definitelytyped--types)
package:

```ts, ignore
// @deno-types="npm:@types/express@^4.17"
import express from "npm:express@^4.17";
```

### Including Node types

Node ships with many built-in types like `Buffer` that might be referenced in an
npm package's types. To load these you must add a types reference directive to
the `@types/node` package:

```ts, ignore
/// <reference types="npm:@types/node" />
```

Note that it is fine to not specify a version for this in most cases because
Deno will try to keep it in sync with its internal Node code, but you can always
override the version used if necessary.

## `--node-modules-dir` flag

npm specifiers resolve npm packages to a central global npm cache. This works
well in most cases and is ideal since it uses less space and doesn't require a
node_modules directory. That said, you may find cases where an npm package
expects itself to be executing from a `node_modules` directory. To improve
compatibility and support those packages, you can use the `--node-modules-dir`
flag.

For example, given `main.ts`:

```ts
import chalk from "npm:chalk@5";

console.log(chalk.green("Hello"));
```

Running this script with a `--node-modules-dir` like so...

```sh
deno run --node-modules-dir main.ts
```

...will create a `node_modules` folder in the current directory with a similar
folder structure to npm.

Note that this is all done automatically when calling deno run and there is no
separate install command necessary.

In the case where you want to modify the contents of the `node_modules`
directory before execution, you can run `deno cache` with `--node-modules-dir`,
modify the contents, then run the script.

For example:

```sh
deno cache --node-modules-dir main.ts
deno run --allow-read=. --allow-write=. scripts/your_script_to_modify_node_modules_dir.ts
deno run --node-modules-dir main.ts
```
