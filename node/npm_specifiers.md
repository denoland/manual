# npm specifiers

Since version 1.28, Deno has native support for import npm packages. This is
done by importing using `npm:` specifiers. `npm:` imports have a higher chance
of compatibility than importing from CDNs, particularly if the modules depend on
artifact files in their package.

It is important to emphasize that even though this feature was stabilized for
use with `deno run` and some other sub commands in Deno 1.28, it is still under
development and doesn't work in some scenarios (ex. with `deno bundle`). You're
likely to find scenarios where something doesn't work. Please report these
problems to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues). We'll
be working hard to improve the compatibility layer and user experience in the
near future. You can follow
[issue 15960](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/15960) for updates.

The way these work is best described with an example:

```ts, ignore
import chalk from "npm:chalk@5";

console.log(chalk.green("Hello!"));
```

These npm specifiers have the following format:

```ts, ignore
npm:<package-name>[@<version-requirement>][/<sub-path>]
```

Another example with express:

```ts, ignore
// main.ts
// @deno-types="npm:@types/express@^4.17"
import express from "npm:express@^4.17";
const app = express();

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello World");
});

app.listen(3000);
console.log("listening on http://localhost:3000/");
```

Then doing the following will start a simple express server:

```sh
$ deno run -A main.ts
listening on http://localhost:3000/
```

When doing this, no `npm install` is necessary and no `node_modules` folder is
created. These packages are also subject to the same permissions as Deno
applications. At the moment though, there are some unnecessary permissions that
get asked for, but in the future the above program will only require network
permissions.

These specifiers currently work with `deno run`, `deno check`, `deno info`,
`deno install`, `deno lsp`, `deno repl`, `deno test`, and `deno bench`, but do
not with `deno bundle`, `deno compile` and `deno vendor` at the moment.

npm package binaries can be executed from the command line without an npm
install using a specifier in the following format:

```ts, ignore
npm:<package-name>[@<version-requirement>][/<binary-name>]
```

For example:

```sh
$ deno run --allow-env --allow-read npm:cowsay@1.5.0 Hello there!
 ______________
< Hello there! >
 --------------
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||
$ deno run --allow-env --allow-read npm:cowsay@1.5.0/cowthink What to eat?
 ______________
( What to eat? )
 --------------
        o   ^__^
         o  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||
```

## TypeScript Types

Many packages ship with types out of the box, you can import those and use them
with types easily:

```ts, ignore
import chalk from "npm:chalk@5";
```

Some packages do not though, but you can specify their types with a
[`@deno-types`](../advanced/typescript/types.md) directive. For example, using a
[`@types`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/type-declarations.html#definitelytyped--types)
package:

```ts, ignore
// @deno-types="npm:@types/express@^4.17"
import express from "npm:express@^4.17";
```

## `--node-modules-dir` flag

npm specifiers resolve npm packages to a central global npm cache. This works
well in most cases and is ideal since it uses less space and doesn't require a
node_modules directory. That said, you may find cases where an npm package
expects itself to be executing from a `node_modules` directory. To improve
compatibility and support those packages, you can use the `--node-modules-dir`
flag.

For example, given `main.ts`:

```ts
import chalk from "npm:chalk@5";

console.log(chalk.green("Hello"));
```

Running this script with a `--node-modules-dir` like so...

```sh
deno run --node-modules-dir main.ts
```

...will create a `node_modules` folder in the current directory with a similar
folder structure to npm.

Note that this is all done automatically when calling deno run and there is no
separate install command necessary.

In the case where you want to modify the contents of the `node_modules`
directory before execution, you can run `deno cache` with `--node-modules-dir`,
modify the contents, then run the script.

For example:

```sh
deno cache --node-modules-dir main.ts
deno run --allow-read=. --allow-write=. scripts/your_script_to_modify_node_modules_dir.ts
deno run --node-modules-dir main.ts
```
