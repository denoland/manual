## Continuous Integration

Deno's built-in tools make it easy to set up Continuous Integration (CI)
pipelines for your projects. Testing, linting and formatting of code can all be
done with the corresponding commands `deno test`, `deno lint` and `deno fmt`. In
addition, you can generate code coverage reports from test results with
`deno coverage` in pipelines.

### Setting up a basic pipeline

This page will show you how to set up basic pipelines for Deno projects in
GitHub Actions. The concepts explained on this page largely apply to other CI
providers as well, such as Azure Pipelines, CircleCI or GitLab.

Building a pipeline for Deno generally starts with checking out the repository
and installing Deno:

```yaml
name: Build

on: push

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: denoland/setup-deno@v1.0.0
        with:
          deno-version: v1.x # Run with latest stable Deno.
```

To expand the workflow just add any of the `deno` subcommands that you might
need:

```yaml
      # Check if the code is formatted according to Deno's default
      # formatting conventions.
      - run: deno fmt --check

      # Scan the code for syntax errors and style issues. If
      # you want to use a custom linter configuration you can add a configuration file with --config <myconfig>
      - run: deno lint

      # Run all test files in the repository and collect code coverage. The example
      # runs with all permissions, but it is recommended to run with the minimal permissions your program needs (for example --allow-read).
      - run: deno test --allow-all --coverage=cov/

      # This generates a report from the collected coverage in `deno test --coverage`. It is
      # stored as a .lcov file which integrates well with services such as Codecov, Coveralls and Travis CI.
      - run: deno coverage --lcov cov/ > cov.lcov
```

### Cross-platform workflows

As a Deno module maintainer, you probably want to know that your code works on
all of the major operating systems in use today: Linux, MacOS and Windows. A
cross-platform workflow can be achieved by running a matrix of parallel jobs,
each one running the build on a different OS:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ ubuntu-20.04, macos-11, windows-2019 ]
    steps:
      - run: deno test --allow-all --coverage cov/
```

> Note: GitHub Actions has a known
> [issue](https://github.com/actions/checkout/issues/135) with handling
> Windows-style line endings (CRLF). This may cause issues when running
> `deno fmt` in a pipeline with jobs that run on `windows`. To prevent this,
> configure the Actions runner to use Linux-style line endings before running
> the `actions/checkout@v2` step:
>
> ```
> git config --system core.autocrlf false
> git config --system core.eol lf
> ```

If you are working with experimental or unstable Deno APIs, you can include a
matrix job running the canary version of Deno. This can help to spot breaking
changes early on:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    continue-on-error: ${{ matrix.canary }} # Continue in case the canary run does not succeed
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ ubuntu-20.04, macos-11, windows-2019 ]
        deno-version: [ v1.x ]
        canary: [ false ]
        include: 
          - deno-version: canary
            os: ubuntu-20.04
            canary: true
```

### Speeding up Deno pipelines

#### Reducing repetition

In cross-platform runs, certain steps of a pipeline do not need to run for each
OS necessarily. For example, generating the same test coverage report on Linux,
MacOS and Windows is a bit redundant. You can use the `if` conditional keyword
of GitHub Actions in these cases. The example below shows how to run code
coverage generation and upload steps only on the `ubuntu` (Linux) runner:

```yaml
- name: Generate coverage report
  if: matrix.os == 'ubuntu-20.04'
  run: deno coverage --lcov cov > cov.lcov

- name: Upload coverage to Coveralls.io
  if: matrix.os == 'ubuntu-20.04'
  # Any code coverage service can be used, Coveralls.io is used here as an example.
  uses: coverallsapp/github-action@master
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # Generated by GitHub.
    path-to-lcov: cov.lcov
```

#### Caching dependencies

As a project grows in size, more and more dependencies tend to be included. Deno
will download these dependencies during testing and if a workflow is run many
times a day, this can become a time-consuming process. A common solution to
speed things up is to cache dependencies so that they do not need to be
downloaded anew.

[Deno stores dependencies locally in a cache directory](https://deno.land/manual/linking_to_external_code).
In a pipeline the cache can be preserved between workflows by setting the
`DENO_DIR` environment variable and adding a caching step to the workflow:

```yaml
# Set DENO_DIR to an absolute or relative path on the runner.
env:
  DENO_DIR: my_cache_directory

steps:
  - name: Cache Deno dependencies 
    uses: actions/cache@v2
    with:
      path: ${{ env.DENO_DIR }}
      key: my_cache_key
```

At first, when this workflow runs the cache is still empty and commands like
`deno test` will still have to download dependencies, but when the job succeeds
the contents of `DENO_DIR` are saved and any subsequent runs can restore them
from cache instead of re-downloading.

There is still an issue in the workflow above: at the moment the name of the
cache key is hardcoded to `my_cache_key`, which is going to restore the same
cache every time, even if one or more dependencies are updated. This can lead to
older versions being used in the pipeline even though you have updated some
dependencies. The solution is to generate a different key each time the cache
needs to be updated, which can be achieved by using a lockfile and by using the
`hashFiles` function provided by GitHub Actions:

```yaml
key: ${{ hashFiles('lock.json') }}
```

To make this work you will also need a have a lockfile in your Deno project,
which is discussed in detail
[here](./linking_to_external_code/integrity_checking.md). Now, if the contents
of `lock.json` are changed, a new cache will be made and used in subsequent
pipeline runs thereafter.

To demonstrate, let's say you have a project that uses the logger from
`deno.land/std`:

```ts
import * as log from "https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/log/mod.ts";
```

In order to increment this version, you can update the `import` statement and
then reload the cache and update the lockfile locally:

```
deno cache --reload --lock=lock.json --lock-write deps.ts
```

You should see changes in the lockfile's contents after running this. When this
is committed and run through the pipeline, you should then see the `hashFiles`
function saving a new cache and using it in any runs that follow.

##### Clearing the cache

Occasionally you may run into a cache that has been corrupted or malformed,
which can happen for various reasons. There is no option in GitHub Actions UI to
clear a cache yet, but to create a new cache you can simply change the name of
the cache key. A practical way of doing so without having to forcefully change
your lockfile is to add a variable to the cache key name, which can be stored as
a GitHub secret and which can be changed if a new cache is needed:

```yaml
key: ${{ secrets.CACHE_VERSION }}-${{ hashFiles('lock.json') }}
```
