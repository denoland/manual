# Using TypeScript

Deno not only supports TypeScript out of the box, but also treats TypeScript as
a first class language. This means the developer experience when authoring and
importing TypeScript will be as easy and straightforward as that of JavaScript.

You can run or import TypeScript without installing anything more than the Deno
CLI.

In this chapter, we'll discuss:
