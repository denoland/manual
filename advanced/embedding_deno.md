# Embedding Deno

Deno consists of multiple parts, one of which is `deno_core`. This is a rust
crate that can be used to embed a JavaScript runtime into your rust application.
Deno is built on top of `deno_core`.

The Deno crate is hosted on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/deno_core).

You can view the API on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/deno_core).
