# The Language Server

The Deno CLI comes with a built in language server that can provide an
intelligent editing experience as well as a way to easily access the other tools
that come built in with Deno. For most users, using the language server would be
via your editor like [Visual Studio Code](../references/vscode_deno.md) or
[other editors](../getting_started/setup_your_environment.md). This section of
the manual is designed for those creating integrations to the language server or
providing a package registry for Deno that integrates intelligently.

In this section we will cover:

- [An Overview of the Language Server](./language_server/overview.md)
- [Import Sompletions and Intelligent Package Registries](./language_server/imports.md)
