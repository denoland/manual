## Using WebAssembly

Designed to be used alongside JavaScript to speed up key application components, [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/)
has a much higher execution speed than JavaScript, similar to C and C++. Deno can execute WebAssembly modules with the
same interfaces that [browsers provide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly).

In this chapter we will discuss:

1. [Using WebAssembly in Deno](webassembly/using_webassembly.md)
2. [Optimizing WebAssembly binaries](webassembly/optimization.md)
