## Using WebAssembly

Designed to be used alongside JavaScript to speed up key application components,
[WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) has a much higher execution speed than
JavaScript, similar to C and C++. Deno can execute WebAssembly modules with the
same interfaces that
[browsers provide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly).

In this chapter we will discuss:

1. [Using WebAssembly in Deno](webassembly/using_wasm.md)
2. [Using the Asynchronous WebAssembly APIs](webassembly/using_wasm_async.md)
3. [Helpful Resources](webassembly/resources.md)
