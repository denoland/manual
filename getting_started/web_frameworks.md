# Web Frameworks

Most likely, if you're building a more complex application, you'll be
interacting with Deno through a web framework. There are two kinds of web
frameworks that Deno supports:

- **Node.js native frameworks/tools/libraries.** Some of the most popular
  tooling, for example esbuild, explicitly supports both Node.js and Deno. The
  drawback here is that you might not get the best experience or performance.
- **Deno native frameworks/tools/libraries.** We present some of these below.

## Deno-native frameworks

### Fresh

[Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/) is the most popular web framework for Deno. It
uses a model where you send no JavaScript to clients by default. The majority of
rendering is done on a server, and the client is only responsible for
re-rendering small
[islands of interactivity](https://jasonformat.com/islands-architecture/). This
means the developer explicitly opts in to client side rendering for specific
components.

### Aleph

[Aleph.js](https://alephjs-alephjs-org-next.deno.dev/docs/get-started) is the
second most popular web framework for Deno. It gives you the same sort of
quick-start with React as Create-React-App. Like Next.js, Aleph provides SSR and
SSG out of the box in order to allow developers to create SEO-friendly apps. In
addition, Aleph provides some other built-in features that donâ€™t come out of the
box in Next.js, such as:

- Hot Reloading (Using React Fast Refresh)
- ESM Import Syntax (No need for webpack)
- TypeScript-Readys

### Ultra

[Ultra](https://ultrajs.dev/) is a modern streaming React framework in Deno that
supports ES modules, import maps, and web streams. It's another alternative to
Aleph.

### Lume

[Lume](https://lume.land/) is a static site generator for Deno that supports any
template engine and is blazingly fast.

### Oak

[Oak](https://deno.land/x/oak) is a popular middleware framework for Deno based
web apps / HTTP servers. It offers additional functionality over the native Deno
HTTP server, including a basic router, JSON parser, middlewares, plugins, etc.

If you have been using Express with Node.js, Oak is the rough equivalent for
Deno.
