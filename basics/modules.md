# Modules

## Concepts

- [import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import)
  allows you to include and use modules held elsewhere, on your local file
  system or remotely.
- Imports are URLs or file system paths.
- [export](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export)
  allows you to specify which parts of your module are accessible to users who
  import your module.

## Overview

Deno by default standardizes the way modules are imported in both JavaScript and
TypeScript using the ECMAScript 6 `import/export` standard.

It adopts browser-like module resolution, meaning that file names must be
specified in full. You may not omit the file extension and there is no special
handling of `index.js`.

```js, ignore
import { add, multiply } from "./arithmetic.ts";
```

Dependencies are also imported directly, there is no package management
overhead. Local modules are imported in exactly the same way as remote modules.
As the examples show below, the same functionality can be produced in the same
way with local or remote modules.

## Local Import

In this example the `add` and `multiply` functions are imported from a local
`arithmetic.ts` module.

**Command:** `deno run local.ts`

```ts, ignore
/**
 * local.ts
 */
import { add, multiply } from "./arithmetic.ts";

function totalCost(outbound: number, inbound: number, tax: number): number {
  return multiply(add(outbound, inbound), tax);
}

console.log(totalCost(19, 31, 1.2));
console.log(totalCost(45, 27, 1.15));

/**
 * Output
 *
 * 60
 * 82.8
 */
```

## Remote Import

In the local import example above an `add` and `multiply` method are imported
from a locally stored arithmetic module. The same functionality can be created
by importing `add` and `multiply` methods from a remote module too.

In this case the Ramda module is referenced, including the version number. Also
note a JavaScript module is imported directly into a TypeScript module, Deno has
no problem handling this.

**Command:** `deno run ./remote.ts`

```ts
/**
 * remote.ts
 */
import {
  add,
  multiply,
} from "https://x.nest.land/ramda@0.27.0/source/index.js";

function totalCost(outbound: number, inbound: number, tax: number): number {
  return multiply(add(outbound, inbound), tax);
}

console.log(totalCost(19, 31, 1.2));
console.log(totalCost(45, 27, 1.15));

/**
 * Output
 *
 * 60
 * 82.8
 */
```

## Export

In the local import example above the `add` and `multiply` functions are
imported from a locally stored arithmetic module. To make this possible the
functions stored in the arithmetic module must be exported.

To do this just add the keyword `export` to the beginning of the function
signature as is shown below.

```ts
/**
 * arithmetic.ts
 */
export function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}

export function multiply(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a * b;
}
```

All functions, classes, constants and variables which need to be accessible
inside external modules must be exported. Either by prepending them with the
`export` keyword or including them in an export statement at the bottom of the
file.


## FAQ

### How do I import a specific version of a module?

Specify the version in the URL. For example, this URL fully specifies the code
being run: `https://unpkg.com/liltest@0.0.5/dist/liltest.js`.

### It seems unwieldy to import URLs everywhere.

> What if one of the URLs links to a subtly different version of a library?

> Isn't it error prone to maintain URLs everywhere in a large project?

The solution is to import and re-export your external libraries in a central
`deps.ts` file (which serves the same purpose as Node's `package.json` file).
For example, let's say you were using the above assertion library across a large
project. Rather than importing
`"https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/testing/asserts.ts"` everywhere, you could
create a `deps.ts` file that exports the third-party code:

**deps.ts**

```ts
export {
  assert,
  assertEquals,
  assertStringIncludes,
} from "https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/testing/asserts.ts";
```

And throughout the same project, you can import from the `deps.ts` and avoid
having many references to the same URL:

```ts, ignore
import { assertEquals, runTests, test } from "./deps.ts";
```

This design circumvents a plethora of complexity spawned by package management
software, centralized code repositories, and superfluous file formats.

### How can I trust a URL that may change?

By using a lock file (with the `--lock` command line flag), you can ensure that
the code pulled from a URL is the same as it was during initial development. You
can learn more about this
[here](./linking_to_external_code/integrity_checking.md).

### But what if the host of the URL goes down? The source won't be available.

This, like the above, is a problem faced by _any_ remote dependency system.
Relying on external servers is convenient for development but brittle in
production. Production software should always vendor its dependencies. In Node
this is done by checking `node_modules` into source control. In Deno this is
done by using the [`deno vendor`](../tools/vendor.md) subcommand.
