# Integrity Checking & Lock Files

## Introduction

Let's say your module depends on remote module `https://some.url/a.ts`. When you
compile your module for the first time `a.ts` is retrieved, compiled and cached.
It will remain this way until you run your module on a new machine (say in
production) or reload the cache (through `deno cache --reload` for example). But
what happens if the content in the remote url `https://some.url/a.ts` is
changed? This could lead to your production module running with different
dependency code than your local module. Deno's solution to avoid this is to use
integrity checking and lock files.

## Caching and lock files

Deno can store and check subresource integrity for modules using a small JSON
file. To opt into a lock file, either:

1. Create a `deno.json` file in the current or an ancestor directory, which will
   automatically create an additive lockfile at `deno.lock`.
2. Use the `--lock=deno.lock` to enable and specify lock file checking. To
   update or create a lock use `--lock=deno.lock --lock-write`. The
   `--lock=deno.lock` tells Deno what the lock file to use is, while the
   `--lock-write` is used to output dependency hashes to the lock file
   (`--lock-write` must be used in conjunction with `--lock`).

A `deno.lock` might look like this, storing a hash of the file against the
dependency:

```json
{
  "https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/textproto/mod.ts": "3118d7a42c03c242c5a49c2ad91c8396110e14acca1324e7aaefd31a999b71a4",
  "https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/io/util.ts": "ae133d310a0fdcf298cea7bc09a599c49acb616d34e148e263bcb02976f80dee",
  "https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/async/delay.ts": "35957d585a6e3dd87706858fb1d6b551cb278271b03f52c5a2cb70e65e00c26a",
   ...
}
```

### Auto-generated lockfile

As mentioned above, when a Deno configuration file is resolved (ex. `deno.json`)
then an additive lockfile will be automatically generated. By default, the path
of this lockfile will be `deno.lock`. You can change this path by updating your
`deno.json` to specify this:

```jsonc
{
  "lock": "./lock.file"
}
```

Or disable automatically creating and validating a lockfile by specifying:

```jsonc
{
  "lock": false
}
```

### Using `--lock` and `--lock-write` flags

A typical workflow will look like this:

**src/deps.ts**

```ts, ignore
// Add a new dependency to "src/deps.ts", used somewhere else.
export { xyz } from "https://unpkg.com/xyz-lib@v0.9.0/lib.ts";
```

Then:

```shell
# Create/update the lock file "deno.lock".
deno cache --lock=deno.lock --lock-write src/deps.ts

# Include it when committing to source control.
git add -u deno.lock
git commit -m "feat: Add support for xyz using xyz-lib"
git push
```

Collaborator on another machine -- in a freshly cloned project tree:

```shell
# Download the project's dependencies into the machine's cache, integrity
# checking each resource.
deno cache --reload --lock=deno.lock src/deps.ts

# Done! You can proceed safely.
deno test --allow-read src
```

## Runtime verification

Like caching above, you can also use lock files during use of the `deno run` sub
command, validating the integrity of any locked modules during the run. Remember
that this only validates against dependencies previously added to the lock file.

You can take this a step further as well by using the `--cached-only` flag to
require that remote dependencies are already cached.

```shell
deno run --lock=deno.lock --cached-only mod.ts
```

This will fail if there are any dependencies in the dependency tree for mod.ts
which are not yet cached.
