# Import Maps

Deno supports [import maps](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps).

You can use import maps with the `--import-map=<FILE>` CLI flag or `importMap`
option in the [configuration file](../../getting_started/configuration_file.md),
the former will take precedence.

Example:

**import_map.json**

```json
{
  "imports": {
    "fmt/": "https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/fmt/"
  }
}
```

**color.ts**

```ts, ignore
import { red } from "fmt/colors.ts";

console.log(red("hello world"));
```

Then:

```shell
$ deno run --import-map=import_map.json color.ts
```

To use your project root for absolute imports:

**import_map.json**

```jsonc
{
  "imports": {
    "/": "./",
    "./": "./"
  }
}
```

**main.ts**

```ts, ignore
import { MyUtil } from "/util.ts";
```

This causes import specifiers starting with `/` to be resolved relative to the
import map's URL or file path.

## Import Maps are for Applications

It is important to note that import map configuration files are
[only applied for Deno applications][scope], not in the various libraries that
your application code may import. This lets you, the application author, have
final say about what versions of libraries get included in your project.

If you are developing a library, you should instead prefer to use the `deps.ts`
pattern discussed in [Managing Dependencies].
